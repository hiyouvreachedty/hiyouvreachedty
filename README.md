- 👋 Hi, I’m @hiyouvreachedty
- 👀 I’m interested in learning and building out a portfolio for not only coding but web design because I'm a sucker for visuals and branding.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything, as I feel you're always learning no matter what but at this current moment I've taken a liking to Python.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Creating automation software that would help brands and social media agencies automate their processes to help smaller business grow.
- 📫 How to reach me I can be reached here, obviously or by Instagram @Ouijesuist
- 😄 Pronouns: Him

- ⚡ Fun fact: I've been boxing for 20 years and I've traveled the world.
- A friend I met up whilst I was in London put the seed in my brain to learn to code back in 2022 and it's been written ever since.
- I used to hack video games and crack programs when I was a kid.
